Welcome to 0.3! This major update brings intelligent content summaries, extensive customization options, and numerous improvements to make your experience smoother and more personalized.

## AI-Powered Summaries (iOS 26+)

AI Summaries leverage on-device Apple Intelligence to provide quick overviews of posts and activities, but requires iOS 26 or later due to Foundation Model framework dependencies.

- Generate quick summaries of posts and activities with on-device Apple Intelligence
- Long-press any post or activity and select "Generate Summary" to get an instant overview
- Enable auto-summaries in settings to automatically generate summaries for new content
- All processing happens on your device - your privacy is protected

## Customizable Content Display

- Control how post titles appear: choose between original formatting, uppercase, or sentence case
- Adjust post description preview length (1-10 lines) to match your reading preference
- Toggle images in post previews on or off for a cleaner feed
- Customize activity titles with the same formatting options as posts
- Hide join/leave buttons on activity cards for a distraction-free view

## Improved Link Handling

- Links from web portal now automatically open in the app when tapped
- Fixed deep linking - tapping skiesmobile:// links in Safari, Messages, or notifications now properly opens the specific content
- Web links in markdown content are intelligently converted to open in-app when possible

## Better Sharing

- Share posts and activities with proper titles, descriptions, and web links
- Improved share sheet experience with rich content previews

## Smarter Caching

- Profile photos now cache properly with 24-hour refresh - no more unnecessary reloading
- Activity details are now cached and stay up-to-date across the app
- Automatic cache validation and repair keeps your offline experience smooth
