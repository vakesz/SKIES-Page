This release focuses on code quality and maintainability. There are no new features—the app works exactly as before, but with a cleaner, more reliable foundation.

## Improvements

- Read state tracking now works correctly when feed items are edited
- Badge counts should update reliably after background refresh and when returning to the app
- Added stricter build settings for better code quality enforcement
- Enhanced thread safety for settings synchronization
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Updated to follow Apple's latest Swift concurrency best practices

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed internal URL conversion issues in rich text
- Fixed incorrect QR code generation in some cases
- Fixed comment UI & text scaling issues
- Fixed an issue where the app would attempt to reauthenticate automatically after signing out
- Fixed demo mode failing to load on first launch
