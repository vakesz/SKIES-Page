This release adds home screen quick actions and a feed filter, along with reliability improvements to background refresh and authentication recovery.

## New Features

- **Pinned posts**: Posts marked as pinned now appear in a dedicated "Pinned" section at the top of the feed
- **Home screen quick actions**: Long-press the app icon to jump directly to Posts, Activities, Search, or your QR code
- **Unread filter for feeds**: Toggle "Show Unread" in the Posts or Activities menu to see only items you haven't read yet, with an "All Caught Up" state when everything is read
- **Redesigned feed toolbar**: Filter toggle is now a dedicated dropdown picker; "Mark all as read" is a separate button (only visible when unread items exist) with confirmation alert

## Improvements

- Profile card now displays more of the email address before truncating
- Version info on Profile tab now shows build number
- About view: Added GitHub to socials, external links now show arrow indicator
- About view: Updated Application Website link and subtitle
- Reduced spacing above app info footer in Settings and About views
- App icon picker uses primary tint color for selection
- Fixed copyright year formatting in app footer
- Notifications now show only title, no author
- User avatars now show initials instead of placeholder image when no photo is set
- Refactored URL scheme handling with strict typing and centralized URL construction
- Circuit breaker no longer records failures when already open, preventing unnecessary cooldown extensions
- Background refresh now attempts silent token acquisition before reporting token expiry
- Auth errors are classified as permanent vs temporary for smarter retry behavior
- Removed image prefetching and cache cleanup from background refresh for faster execution
- Notification settings now properly blocked when iOS background refresh is disabled
- Removed "Disabled" option from background refresh interval picker (use iOS Settings to disable)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed activities showing "Closed" instead of "Joined" when user was already signed up for a closed event
- Fixed background refresh sometimes failing silently due to expired auth tokens
- Fixed activity reminder warning spam when reminder timing is not configured
- Fixed background refresh and notification scheduling when iOS background refresh is disabled
- Fixed demo mode not persisting across app relaunches
