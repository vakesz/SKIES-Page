This release adds home screen quick actions and a feed filter, along with reliability improvements to background refresh and authentication recovery.

## New Features

- **Pinned posts**: Posts marked as pinned now appear in a dedicated "Pinned" section at the top of the feed
- **Home screen quick actions**: Long-press the app icon to jump directly to Posts, Activities, Search, or your QR code
- **Unread filter for feeds**: Toggle "Show Unread" in the Posts or Activities menu to see only items you haven't read yet, with an "All Caught Up" state when everything is read
- **Redesigned feed toolbar**: Filter toggle is now a dedicated dropdown picker; "Mark all as read" is a separate button (only visible when unread items exist) with confirmation alert
- **Bookmarks "All" tab** showing both posts and activities when both are bookmarked

## Improvements

- Profile card shows more of email before truncating
- Version info now shows build number on Profiles screen
- About view: added GitHub, external links show arrow indicator
- App icon picker uses primary tint for selection
- Avatars show initials when no photo or placeholder is set
- Background refresh attempts silent token refresh before failing
- Removed image prefetching from background refresh for faster execution
- Notification settings blocked when iOS background refresh is disabled
- Simplified comments loading in post and activity detail views

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed crash on background refresh launch
- Fixed background refresh blocking main thread
- Fixed activities showing "Closed" instead of "Joined" for signed-up closed events
- Fixed background refresh failing silently with expired tokens
- Fixed demo mode breaking after relaunch
- Fixed activity participants list not paginating correctly from cache
